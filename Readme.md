1.  Analyse the Dataset to view the imbalance between fraud class and legitimate class

2.  Split data into train and test set

3.  Apply SMOTE to oversample the train set

4.  Use sampling techniques: Random Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Stratified Sampling to generate samples of the training set. Sample size can be calculated and used according to the formula Z^2*p*(1-p)/E^2, by taking confidence interval as 95% and margin of error as 5%

5.  Train classification models over the sample: Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, SVM with RBF Kernel, Random Forest and Decision Tree

6.  Calculate Accuracy for each model
